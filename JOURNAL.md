# June 9th: Brainstorming

So I plan on have like 4 standard servo as the main load bearing leg, and have 8 mirco servo for the joints. I will probally use a servo driver and a xiao seeed rp2040. However power will likly be a issue

# June 10th: Desgining Chassis

Made the chassis connected the the standard servo, I tweak the desgin a bit but overall I think it should work. It took a bit of learning as I'm still learning cadding.

Made the standard servo to mircoservo connector. I probaly need some tape for this but it should be a decent fit

Added the second joint, I'm think of using glue for stronger connection it should probably work.
